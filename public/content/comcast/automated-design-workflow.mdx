## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for processing a Geopackage using QGIS to prepare specific data layers for input into Sttar. The target data layers include:

- **Aerial Drops**
- **Underground Drops**
- **Pedestal/Handholes**
- **OLT**
- **HP**
- **Poles**
- **Routes AER**
- **Route UG**

---

## Requirements

- **QGIS software**
- Katapult `Nodes` and `Connections` shapefiles.
- The Python script `` `comcast_data_preparation.py` ``.
- The Python script `` `process_cad_imports.py` ``.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open QGIS

1. Launch QGIS.

> **Outcome**: QGIS is successfully opened and ready for data preparation.

---

### Step 2: Open the Python Console

1. Access the Python Console:
   - Go to `` `Plugins > Python Console` `` in the top menu.

![Open Python Console](path/to/screenshot2.png)  
*Navigate to the Python Console to enable scripting features in QGIS.*

---

### Step 3: Open the Script Editor

1. Open the Script Editor:
   - In the Python Console, click the **Show Editor** button (paper and pencil icon).

![Open Script Editor](path/to/screenshot3.png)  
*Access the Script Editor to load your custom Python scripts.*

---

### Step 4: Load the Script

1. Load the script into the editor:
   - Click the **Open Script** button (folder icon) in the Script Editor.
   - Navigate to the location where you saved `` `comcast_data_prep.py` ``.
   - Select the file and click **Open**.

*Steps to locate and open the script file in the Script Editor.*

---

### Step 5: Run the Script

1. Run the script:
   - Click the **Run Script** button (green play icon) in the Script Editor.

![Run the Script](path/to/screenshot5.png)  
*Executing the script to begin processing the data.*

---

### Step 6: Select the &apos;Connections&apos; Shapefile

1. A file dialog will prompt you to select the `Connections` shapefile:
   - Navigate to the folder containing your shapefiles.
   - Select `` `Connections.shp` `` and click **Open**.

![Select Connections Shapefile](path/to/screenshot6.png)  
*Example of selecting the `Connections.shp` file.*

---

### Step 7: Select the &apos;Nodes&apos; Shapefile

1. A file dialog will prompt you to select the `Nodes` shapefile:
   - Navigate to the folder containing your shapefiles.
   - Select `` `Nodes.shp` `` and click **Open**.

![Select Nodes Shapefile](path/to/screenshot7.png)  
*Example of selecting the `Nodes.shp` file.*

---

### Step 8: Script Execution

1. The script will:
   - Automatically load the shapefiles.
   - Select specific features.
   - Export the processed features into new shapefiles.
2. A new folder named **Sttar Inputs** will be created in the same directory as your input shapefiles.

> **Outcome**: The folder **Sttar Inputs** now contains newly processed shapefiles, ready for Sttar.

*Overview of the script execution and output folder creation.*

---

### Step 9: Verify the Output

1. Check the output folder:
   - Navigate to the folder containing your input shapefiles.
   - Open the **Sttar Inputs** folder to verify the creation of new shapefiles, such as:
     - `` `input_aerial_routes.shp` ``
     - `` `input_poles.shp` ``

## Overview of Sttar Tools and Layers

Sttar provides a comprehensive suite of tools and features to help you interact with and modify your network map effectively. Below is an overview of the main tools and layers available in Sttar.

### Tools Overview

The tools in Sttar are designed to make it easy to manipulate elements on the map and compute network designs efficiently. Here&apos;s a summary of the main tools:

- **Map Access**:  
  Access the map interface via **`Project > Map`** to view and edit your network design.

  ![Open Sttar Map](path/to/screenshot15.png)  
  *The map interface in Sttar provides a visual representation of your network design.*

- **Select/Unselect Tools**:  
  These tools let you select or deselect elements on the map for editing.

- **Create/Modify Tools**:  
  Use these tools to add or adjust features on the map, such as creating new OLTs, modifying splitters, or adjusting connections.

- **Assign to Parent Node Tool**:  
  This tool allows you to link a point feature (e.g., an address or HP) to a parent node (e.g., a splitter or OLT) within the network hierarchy.

- **Delete Tool**:  
  Removes selected elements from the map. Use this in conjunction with the selection tool.

- **Pan Mode**:  
  Navigate across the map smoothly by enabling this mode.

- **Compute Automated Design**:  
  This feature recalculates the network design based on recent changes and generates updated results.

### Layers Overview

Sttar organizes network components into layers, each representing a distinct aspect of your design. These layers make it easy to manage and analyze the network structure. Key layers include:

- **Network Nodes**:  
  Represent critical equipment in your network, such as OLTs and splitters.

- **Network Endpoints**:  
  Represent addresses (HPs) that are endpoints in your network.

- **Service Areas**:  
  Polygons that define the boundaries of service areas for each design architecture level:
  - **Level 1**: OLT
  - **Level 2**: Primary splitters
  - **Level 5**: Secondary splitters
  - **Level 6**: Tertiary splitters

### Customizing Layer Symbology

To better visualize the network components, you can customize the symbology of layers.  
- Right-click on a layer and select **`Symbology`** to adjust the colors, symbols, or styles representing network elements.
