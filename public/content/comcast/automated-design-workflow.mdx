## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for processing a Geopackage using QGIS to prepare specific data layers for input into Sttar. The target data layers include:

- **Aerial Drops**
- **Underground Drops**
- **Pedestal/Handholes**
- **OLT**
- **HP**
- **Poles**
- **Routes AER**
- **Route UG**

---

## Requirements

- **QGIS software**
- Katapult `Nodes` and `Connections` shapefiles.
- The Python script `` `comcast_data_preparation.py` ``.
- The Python script `` `process_cad_imports.py` ``.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open QGIS

1. Launch QGIS.

> **Outcome**: QGIS is successfully opened and ready for data preparation.

---

### Step 2: Open the Python Console

1. Access the Python Console:
   - Go to `` `Plugins > Python Console` `` in the top menu.

*Navigate to the Python Console to enable scripting features in QGIS.*

---

### Step 3: Open the Script Editor

1. Open the Script Editor:
   - In the Python Console, click the **Show Editor** button (paper and pencil icon).

*Access the Script Editor to load your custom Python scripts.*

---

### Step 4: Load the Script

1. Load the script into the editor:
   - Click the **Open Script** button (folder icon) in the Script Editor.
   - Navigate to the location where you saved `` `comcast_data_prep.py` ``.
   - Select the file and click **Open**.

---

### Step 5: Run the Script

1. Run the script:
   - Click the **Run Script** button (green play icon) in the Script Editor.

*Executing the script to begin processing the data.*

---

### Step 6: Select the ‘Connections’ Shapefile

1. A file dialog will prompt you to select the `Connections` shapefile:
   - Navigate to the folder containing your shapefiles.
   - Select `` `Connections.shp` `` and click **Open**.

*Example of selecting the `Connections.shp` file.*

---

### Step 7: Select the ‘Nodes’ Shapefile

1. A file dialog will prompt you to select the `Nodes` shapefile:
   - Navigate to the folder containing your shapefiles.
   - Select `` `Nodes.shp` `` and click **Open**.

*Example of selecting the `Nodes.shp` file.*

---

### Step 8: Script Execution

1. The script will:
   - Automatically load the shapefiles.
   - Select specific features.
   - Export the processed features into new shapefiles.
2. A new folder named **Sttar Inputs** will be created in the same directory as your input shapefiles.

> **Outcome**: The folder **Sttar Inputs** now contains newly processed shapefiles, ready for Sttar.

*Overview of the script execution and output folder creation.*

---

### Step 9: Verify the Output

1. Check the output folder:
   - Navigate to the folder containing your input shapefiles.
   - Open the **Sttar Inputs** folder to verify the creation of new shapefiles, such as:
     - `` `input_aerial_routes.shp` ``
     - `` `input_poles.shp` ``

## Opening Sttar and Preparing for Data Input

---

### Step 1: Open Sttar Software

1. Launch the Sttar software. Choose between:
   - **Sttar Advanced Designer**: For extended capabilities, including modifying design rules or configurations.
   - **Sttar Planner**: Recommended for executing designs without advanced configuration adjustments.
2. **Note**: This guide focuses on **Sttar Advanced Designer** due to its extended features.

*Example of the Sttar software main interface upon launching.*

---

### Step 2: Import Configuration or Project File

1. Open the configuration file (`` `.sdconfig` ``) corresponding to your design area.
2. Save it as a project file (`` `.sdproj` ``) to prevent modifications to the original configuration.

> **Tip**: Always save your project immediately to preserve the original configuration.
