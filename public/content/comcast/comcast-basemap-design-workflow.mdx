# Preparing Comcast Basemap Design

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for preparing survey data in QGIS and importing it into a basemap in AutoCAD Map 3D. It is designed to streamline the conversion and organization of data layers, ensuring a smooth workflow from data preparation in QGIS to final integration in AutoCAD. The primary tasks include downloading survey data, preparing shapefiles, processing them in QGIS, and finally importing them into AutoCAD.

## Requirements

- **QGIS software** for data preparation
- **AutoCAD Map 3D** for data import and visualization
- Survey data files (`Nodes` and `Connections` shapefiles) from **Katapult**
- **Python script** named `basemap_data_prep.py` for automation and data processing

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Download Survey Data

1. Access the Katapult website and log in with your credentials.
2. Navigate to the survey data section and download the required data.
3. Ensure you have two `.shp` files: `Nodes.shp` and `Connections.shp`.

### Step 2: Open QGIS

1. Launch QGIS.
2. Prepare the `Connections` and `Nodes` shapefiles:
   - **Reproject** both shapefiles to the correct Coordinate Reference System (CRS) for your project.
   - **Add the 'RTFTG' field** (Integer) to the `Connections` shapefile:
      - Use the Field Calculator to create the new field.
      - Set the value of `RTFTG` to match the `length` field but as an integer instead of a decimal.

### Step 3: Open the Python Console

1. Access the Python Console:
   - In the top menu, go to **Plugins > Python Console**.

### Step 5: Load the Script

1. Load the script into the Editor:
   - In the Script Editor, click the **Open Script** button (a folder icon).
   - Navigate to the location where you saved `basemap_data_prep.py`.
   - Select the `basemap_data_prep.py` file and click **Open**.

### Step 6: Run the Script

1. Run the script:
   - In the Script Editor, click the **Run Script** button (a green play button).

### Step 7: Select the ‘Connections’ Shapefile

1. Select the `Connections` shapefile:
   - A file dialog will appear, prompting you to select the `Connections` shapefile.
   - Navigate to the folder containing your shapefiles.
   - Select the `Connections.shp` file and click **Open**.

### Step 8: Select the ‘Nodes’ Shapefile

1. Select the `Nodes` shapefile:
   - Another file dialog will appear, prompting you to select the `Nodes` shapefile.
   - Navigate to the folder containing your shapefiles.
   - Select the `Nodes.shp` file and click **Open**.

### Step 9: Importing Data into AutoCAD Map 3D

1. **Open AutoCAD Map 3D**:
   - Start AutoCAD Map 3D, which supports `.shp` file imports, and open your project.
   - Set your AutoCAD project to the appropriate Coordinate System.

2. **Initiate Import**:
   - Type `MAPIMPORT` in the command line and press Enter.
   - When the import menu appears, select all shapefiles prepared earlier for import and click **OK**.

3. **Assign Layers to Drawing Layers**:
   - When prompted, assign each `.shp` layer to its corresponding "Drawing Layer" and block in AutoCAD.
   - Use the import profile `comcast_profile.ipf` to automatically populate this menu.

4. **Finalize Import**:
   - Click **OK** to complete the import.

### Step 10: Synchronizing Blocks in AutoCAD

1. **Sync Attributes**:
   - After importing the data, type `ATTSYNC` in the AutoCAD command line and press Enter.
   - Set the command to "Select" mode, press Enter, then click the block you wish to synchronize.
   - Confirm by pressing "Yes" to update the block’s attributes based on the newly imported data.

2. **Repeat for All Blocks**:
   - Continue the `ATTSYNC` process for each block that requires synchronization to ensure all data displays correctly.

3. **Completion and Verification**:
   - Once all blocks are synchronized, review your network design to confirm that all layers, blocks, and attributes are correctly placed and visible.
   - Save your AutoCAD project to preserve the imported data and the work completed during synchronization.
